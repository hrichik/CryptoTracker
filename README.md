# CryptoTracker
A C#/.NET Application I made that uses APIs to retrieve USD and CAD prices on cryptocurrency coins inputted by the user.

- Leveraged async/await with Tasks to handle API calls efficiently without blocking the application.
- Implemented HTTP requests to the CoinGecko API to fetch live cryptocurrency prices.
- Parsed JSON responses using System.Text.Json to dynamically extract price data.
- Designed an interactive infinite loop that continuously accepts user input, with a custom keyword to exit.
- Added error handling to gracefully manage invalid inputs or failed API calls.
- Applied currency conversion logic by calculating CAD values from USD prices.
- Enhanced the console output by using colored text for clearer visualization of results.
